                    <p>Jenny describes herself as a nomad with a constant thirst to explore!</p>

                    <p>However it was not always this simple for her.Jenny suffers with severe asthma and back in 2012, she had an almost fatal attack which left her in a wheelchair for a number of months. She experienced first hand, the hassle that wheelchair users face in navigating every day life.</p>

                    <p>When she recovered, Jenny immediately set off on an epic adventure to Costa Rica to celebrate her 21st birthday. While she was there, having the time of her life, she couldn't help but remember where she was only months earlier and often thought "I wouldn't be able to do this if I was in a wheelchair".</p>

                    <p>It was from this experience the idea for Accessible Adventures was born. Jenny is passionate about everybody being able to access the wonders that the world has to offer.</p>

                        <p>In 2013, having already been all over Europe, Charlie decided to travel to Costa Rica for his 21st birthday.</p>
    
                        <p>A lasting friendship was inevitable. After Costa Rica, Charlie travelled to Canada where he fell ill with a collapsed lung. He had to have emergency surgery and like Jenny, it took him months to recover.</p>
    
                        <p>However, recover he did, and 9 months later, he returned to Canada to to climb several of it's highest mountain peaks and hike 450km of coastline! From this experience, Charlie is determined to make other people's travel dreams come true as he did!</p>
